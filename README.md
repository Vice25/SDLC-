# SDLC-Software Development Lifecycle

I have mofified Java files and created an executable Jar file for our project SNHU Travel. I added text and pix according to our practice Scrum meeting. I have written letters to our practice Product Owner and Tester.

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Creating user stories helps me interpret user needs, writing the stories helps me understand their needs and I can pass that along to the development team.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I have learned a lot from Agile, I plan to always remember to be 100% transparent, open, and honest. To share everything and always remember I am part of a team.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Always maintain the principles of the Scrum framework and do your best, do it right the first time and always remember to work toward perfection.
